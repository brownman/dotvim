# .vim by Potapov Sergey (aka Blake)

## What is it?
This is my daily use .vim. It includes my vimrc file, plugins, syntax checkers, color themes, snippets and so on. Everything what makes me happy:) Since I am a ruby developer it contains a lot of ruby oriented things.

## Install
Clone git repository:
    git clone https://github.com/greyblake/dotvim.git $HOME/.vim
Install git submodules:
    cd $HOME/.vim
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
Create a symbol link to vimrc:
    ln -s $HOME/.vim/vimrc $HOME/.vimrc 

## Requirements
Some plugins and features need builtin python and ruby interpreters.
